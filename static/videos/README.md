# Video Files for 60 Seconds to Napoli

Add your video files here:

## Required Videos:

1. **pizza-hero.mp4** - Hero background video (recommended: 1920x1080, 10-30 seconds loop)
   - Should show pizza being made or restaurant ambiance
   - Keep file size under 10MB for fast loading

2. **pizza-making.mp4** - Showcase video (recommended: 1280x720)
   - Shows the pizza-making process
   - Can be longer (30-60 seconds)

## Tips:
- Use compressed MP4 format (H.264 codec)
- Videos should be muted or have subtle audio
- Consider using a video from 60secondstonapoli.de or Instagram
- You can download videos from their social media or request official media

## Fallback:
If videos are not available, the site will show fallback images:
- `../images/hero-pizza.jpg` - Hero background image
- `../images/pizza-making.jpg` - Showcase section image

Add high-quality pizza photos to these locations as fallback.
